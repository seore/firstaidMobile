## Why I Built This
This project aims to provide quick and accessible first-aid knowledge, especially for people in low-income regions, rural communities, and areas with limited healthcare access. Many emergencies happen where medical knowledge is low, literacy levels vary, or internet access is unreliable.
The app simplifies complex medical procedures with icons, illustrations, minimal text, and mobile-first interaction, enabling anyone to react quickly in critical situations without needing to read long medical instructions.
By focusing on offline access, local context, and low-literacy design, the app empowers individuals and families to take immediate action during emergencies while waiting for professional help.
